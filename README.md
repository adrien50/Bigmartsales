# Bigmart sales predictions
## Problem Statement
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim of this data science project is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.
Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.
The data has missing values as some stores do not report all the data due to technical glitches. Hence, it will be required to treat them accordingly.
## Project Flow
* Importing the Dataset and performing basic EDA
* Checking for the null values and describing the variables
* Imputation of the Null-Values using pivot tables
* Using boxplot for identifying outliers
* Using seaborn to understand the contribution of the categorical values on target variables
* Applying boosting models like Gradient Boosting Tree and XGboost
* Standardization and effect of Standardization
* Implementing Robust Scaler and Normalization
* Concluding the final model and predicting for the test data set
* Saving the model using Joblib
